Design, Auditor, and Development Accessibility Annotations

Repository created by Crystal Scott, Freelance Web Accessibility Engineer.

# Project Intent
The project aims to create a website for Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) that serves as a central hub for HHMI's accessible design system. The website will contain an annotation repository for designs in Figma as well as guidance for developers to engineer accessible components and webpages. The primary objective is to promote accessibility awareness and streamline the design annotation process and developer hand-off, ensuring that HHMI's digital content complies with the highest accessibility standards.

# Scope
Accessibility Standards: The project will strictly adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA, ensuring that all digital assets meet rigorous accessibility standards.

WAI-ARIA Best Practices: Incorporating Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) best practices to enhance the accessibility of interactive elements, thus improving user experiences for individuals with disabilities.

HTML5 Best Practices: The project will follow HTML5 best practices, emphasizing semantic HTML elements, proper document structure, and coding standards to lay a strong foundation for accessible web content.

Bootstrap Framework: Leveraging the Bootstrap front-end development framework to create responsive, accessible, and consistent user interfaces that work seamlessly across various devices and browsers.

Designer Guidance: The project will include designer guidance to assist in the creation of born-accessible components and web pages.

Auditor Guidance and Annotation Repository: The website will serve as an annotation repository for designs in Figma, simplifying the annotation process and ensuring that design teams can easily add accessibility annotations to their work.

Developer Guidance: The project will include developer guidance to assist in the creation of born-accessible components and web pages.

By achieving these objectives, the project equips HHMI with a robust accessible design system for designers and developers with a user-friendly Figma annotation repository. This empowers HHMI teams to create universally accessible digital content, contributing to HHMI's mission of advancing accessible biomedical research and education.
