                        <p>Follow these steps to create design annotations for accessibility in Figma.</p>

                        <h2>Phase One: Annotating Figma Boards for Design Changes</h2>
                        <p>Figma boards should be analyzed using a combination of automated testing tools and manual
                            testing tools to clearly identify WCAG defects that must be fixed by the designer.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Large and Regular sized text color contrast issues</li>
                            <li>Non-text color contrast issues</li>
                            <li>Touch target size issues</li>
                            <li>Missing elements such as: headings, buttons, necessary controls</li>
                            <li>Form labeling, status, and error messaging</li>
                            <li>Resize/Reflow issues</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>If any accessibility issues or failures are identified during the phase one design review, 
                            add a comment directly to the Figma board and tag the designer. Provide detailed information 
                            about the issue and offer recommendations for fixing it. Once the designer makes the necessary 
                            adjustments, review the design again to ensure all issues are resolved before moving on to phase two. 
                            Be sure to thoroughly review the Figma boards and prototypes, asking any questions needed to fully 
                            understand the user flow and interactions. This will help you identify potential issues and prepare 
                            the walkthrough documentation for the developers.</p>

                        <p>Final design boards should have an accessibility layer added with your plugin of choice, such
                            as the Include plugin by eBay. Follow these steps:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Outline Landmarks (naming duplicates and regions appropriately) and heading levels
                                elements with the plugin.</li>
                            <li>Using an accessibility annotation kit, add sticky notes to all: meaningful and
                                decorative images and graphics, links and buttons.</li>
                            <li>Add number badges to all first instance elements and create a side panel for written
                                annotations using those numbers.</li>

                        A11y Annotation Kit</a> tags to the design. Start by examining the structure and identifying key elements such as links, buttons, images, headings, paragraphs, and lists. Find the appropriate annotation tag for each element, then copy, paste, and add it to the accessibility layer.</p>
                                    <p>If you know the URL for a link, add it to the corresponding annotation tag. If you have the alt text for an image, include it in the annotation tag as well. Also, add any additional tags like the "Skip to Main Content" link. When placing the tags, ensure that they do not cover any meaningful content within the design.</p>
                                    <p>If a tag is too long or might obscure important content, it's preferable to place the tag outside the accessibility layer and use arrows to point to the relevant element. Please avoid covering meaningful content with the annotation tags. Once you have added tags to the first instances of all meaningful and decorative elements, you may move on to the next step.</p>

                                    <p>In this step, you'll identify and annotate more complex elements within the Figma design that are not fully covered by standard annotation tags. These elements require additional notes to ensure they are built to be accessible and WCAG conformant.</p>
                                    <p>The annotation notes should include any semantic and/or role requirements, accessible name requirements with suggestions, and any required ARIA attributes that convey state or function, such as: Static, Focusable, Focused, Hover, Expanded, Collapsed, Current, Selected, Pressed, Disabled, Enabled, Error, Success, Active, Activated, Dragged, On, Off. Additionally, provide instructions on the element’s functionality that may not be fully clear from the Figma design alone.</p>

For this example, we will be annotating the "Skip to main content" link. This element is located under "Structure" in the sidebar navigation panel, and within the "Page" section under "Bypass Blocks." Inside this accordion, you'll find a tag for auditors and a copy-and-paste section with a border and a Copy button.</p>

                                    <p>In this step, auditors will create an interactive walkthrough document using Google Docs. Name the document with the name of the project followed by "Interactive Walkthrough Document." Be sure to include your name at the top of the document, along with the purpose and scope, followed by a table of contents.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The walkthrough document should start at the topmost level of the interactive, beginning with the navigation menu. For each element, provide specific examples and detail their accessibility requirements, tips, and tricks. Where applicable, include links to relevant accessibility guidelines and considerations from this A11y Annotation Repository.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Structure the document by page and component, and ensure the correct heading hierarchy is used so that the table of contents aligns properly. After listing out all interactions, user flows, and complex components, include a section at the end for general accessibility considerations. This section should also include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>WCAG 2.1 AA Understanding document links</li>
                                        <li>ARIA specification links</li>
                                        <li>W3C Authoring Practices links</li>
                                        <li>Relevant resources from Deque and other accessibility tools</li>
